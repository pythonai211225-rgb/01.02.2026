Use **Python code only**

## Question 1 – Card Game: WAR

### Objective

Build a simple card game between a player and the computer  
The goal is to be the **first to reach 10 points**  

### Game Rules

* The player gets **one random card**  
* The computer gets **one random card**  
* Card values:

  * A (Ace) → highest
  * K (King)
  * Q (Queen)
  * J (Jack) 
  * 10, 9, 8, .... 2
* Use this code to generate random cards: <a href="cards.py">click here</a>

### Scoring Rules

* Player card > Computer card → Player gets **+1 point**
* Computer card > Player card → Computer gets **+1 point**
* Draw (same value) → **0 points** to both

### Game Flow

* Start both scores at 0
* Repeat rounds:

  * Deal one card to the player
  * Deal one card to the computer
  * Show both cards and their values
  * Update scores according to the rules
* The game ends when:

  * Player score reaches **10** → Player wins
  * Computer score reaches **10** → Computer wins

### Example Round

```
Player card: K ♠️   
Computer card: 7 ♦️ 

Player wins the round (+1 point)
Score:
Player: 4
Computer: 3
```

### Example Draw

```
Player card: 9 ❤️
Computer card: 9 ♣️

Draw – no points awarded
```

## ⭐ Bonus: ⭐ Card Game: 21 Boom Challenge 

### Objective

Build a simple two-player card game.
The goal is to get **as close as possible to 21** without going over.

### Card Rules

* Number cards → value is the number
* J / Q / K → value is 10
* A (Ace) → value is 1
* Use this code to generate random cards: <a href="cards.py">click here</a>

### Game Setup

* There are **2 players**: Player 1 and Player 2
* Each player starts with **2 random cards**
* Each player plays **one at a time**

### Player Turn Rules

During a player turn:

* Show the current cards and total value
* Ask the player to choose:

```
0 = STOP
1 = CONTINUE
```

* If the player chooses **CONTINUE (1)** → give one more card
* If the player chooses **STOP (0)** → end the turn
* If total equals **21** → instant win
* If total is **greater than 21** → player is disqualified

### Game Flow

#### Player 1 plays first

* Player 1 keeps choosing STOP or CONTINUE until:

  * they stop
  * reach 21
  * or are disqualified

#### Player 2 plays second

* Player 2 plays only **after Player 1 finishes**
* Same rules apply

### Winner Decision

* If one player is disqualified → the other player wins
* If both players are valid:

  * the player **closer to 21** wins
* If both totals are equal → draw

### Example – Game Flow (Single Player)

**Initial state:**

```
Player 1 cards:
7 ♦️  8 ♣️
Total: 15

Choose:
0 = STOP
1 = CONTINUE
```

**Player chooses: 1 (CONTINUE)**

```
Player 1 cards:
7 ♦️  8 ♣️  A ❤️
Total: 16

Choose:
0 = STOP
1 = CONTINUE
```

**Player chooses: 1 (CONTINUE)**

```
Player 1 cards:
7 ♦️  8 ♣️  A ❤️  K ♠️
Total: 26

❌ Player 1 is disqualified
```

### Example – Stopping in Time

```
Player 1 cards:
10 ♠️  9 ♦️
Total: 19

Choose:
0 = STOP
1 = CONTINUE
```

Player chooses: **0 (STOP)**

```
Player 1 stops with total: 19
```

### Example – Player 2

```
Player 1 cards:
10 ❤️  10 ♠️
Total: 20 
20 > 19  🎯 WINNER OF THIS ROUND
```
